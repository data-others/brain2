# Brain Diffusion MRI Datasets (data-others/brain)

This repository hosts curated external **human brain diffusion MRI datasets** sourced from publicly available archives (e.g., Zenodo, Dryad, ScienceDB). The collections are provided as-is and are intended for **research, validation, benchmarking, and educational use** in neuroimaging and tractography tool development.

The datasets focus on **multi-shell dMRI**, **advanced microstructural imaging**, **test–retest studies**, and **high-resolution acquisitions** that are valuable for studying structural connectivity and modeling white matter microarchitecture.

All datasets retain their original **license**, **citation**, and **metadata** as required by the data owners.
