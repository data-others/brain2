
This dataset is a part of the CHIMGEN study, which is the largest prospective neuroimaging genetic cohort for Chinese Han adults with lifespan natural and socioeconomic measurements obtained from remote sensing. All participants were recruited by advertisements posted in colleges and communities. Participants were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: regular smoker, pregnancy, abnormal color discrimination, a history of alcohol or drug abuse, currently any medication, MRI contraindications, neuropsychiatric or severe somatic disorder and sedative-hypnotic medication within a month or any medication for major neuropsychiatric disorders.

This dataset contained multimodal neuroimaging data from 215 right-handed Chinese healthy volunteers (156 females; 18-30 years old, mean = 22.55, SD = 2.68). The brain images were acquired by a 3.0-Tesla scanner (GE MR 750) at the MRI Research Center in the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The multimodal imaging protocol implemented a set of MRI sequences of the high-resolution T1-weighted structural, resting-state functional, diffusion tensor, and arterial spin labeling MRI.

We are releasing these data for both research and education training in human brain sciences. Specifically, to protect personal information, we applied the face masking toolkit to achieve privacy anonymization by blurring facial information while all the participants agreed to share their anonymized data to the public. To monitor the quality of all structural and functional images for each participant, we also employed mri_qc toolkit for generating reports on the data quality, which are included in the sharing. All data structures conform to the specification of BIDS data structure.
